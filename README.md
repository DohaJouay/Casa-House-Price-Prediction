This repository contains a project I worked on entitled: Casa House Price Prediction. 
In this project, we use data we scraped from the web (from websites such as AVITO and MUBAWAB) in the prediction of house prices. We also did data vizualisation to have a better idea about the different relationships and correlations existing between the different variables we have.
